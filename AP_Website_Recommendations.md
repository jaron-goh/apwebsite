# Authoritative Productions — Website Improvement Recommendations
*Prepared for internal review · authoritativeproductions.com · Feb 2026*

---

## Priority 1 — Critical (Do These First)

### 1.1 Populate the Selected Work Section
The work section is the most important part of any creative studio's website — it's where decisions are made. Currently, two of the four project tiles appear to have missing or unrendering visuals (AI Avatar Campaigns and Real Estate AI Staging).

**Recommended actions:**
- Replace all four tiles with actual deliverables — real AI-generated renders, avatar video clips, staging before/afters, and corporate video snippets
- Each tile should have: a thumbnail/video, project name, client sector (not necessarily client name), service type, and a one-line outcome statement (e.g. *"Cut post-production time by 60% for a financial services campaign"*)
- Add a hover state or click-through to a short case study or lightbox for at least 2 of the 4 projects
- If real client work is under NDA, create high-quality conceptual showcase pieces specifically for the site

---

### 1.2 Fix the "Blue-Chip Clients Served" Stat
The current stat reads **"8+ Blue-Chip Clients Served"** — but the logos section already names 8 specific brands. This makes the number feel like an undercount and undermines credibility.

**Recommended fix options (choose one):**
- Change to total number of projects delivered over 8 years (e.g. *"60+ Projects Delivered"*)
- Change to *"8+ Enterprise Clients"* and clarify the stat refers to enterprise-tier specifically
- Replace entirely with a more meaningful metric: *"SGD X M+ in Production Value Delivered"* or *"3 Industries Served"*

---

### 1.3 Add a Testimonial or Social Proof Quote
Logos alone are passive trust signals. An attributed quote from a real client contact turns social proof into a conversion tool.

**Recommended actions:**
- Source one or two short testimonials from existing clients (corporate video clients are ideal given brand weight)
- Place one quote directly beneath or within the Blue-Chip Roster section
- Format: Pull quote, name, title, company — keep it 1–2 sentences max
- If clients are hesitant to be named publicly, use initials and company type (e.g. *"Head of Marketing, Major Singapore Bank"*)

---

## Priority 2 — High Impact

### 2.1 Add a "How We Work" or Engagement Model Section
First-time B2B buyers — especially those unfamiliar with AI services — often drop off because they don't know what the engagement process looks like. Removing this uncertainty increases form submissions.

**Recommended structure (3-step visual):**
1. **Discovery** — Brief + objectives, we handle the brief-to-strategy translation
2. **Production** — AI-powered or traditional production, depending on scope
3. **Delivery** — Final assets, revisions included, fast turnaround

Keep it to one paragraph or a clean 3-column visual row. Position it between the Services and Clients sections.

---

### 2.2 Add a Pricing Signal or Engagement Anchor
There is currently no indication of project scale or minimum engagement. This creates hesitation for both small clients who fear they can't afford you and enterprise buyers who want to confirm you operate at their level.

**Recommended options:**
- Add a subtle line to the contact section: *"Project-based engagements. No retainers required."*
- Or add a starting anchor: *"AI projects from SGD 1,500 · Traditional production from SGD 3,000"* (adjust to actual figures)
- Alternatively, add a *"Who We Work With"* qualifier paragraph listing client types/sizes you target

---

### 2.3 Expand the Contact Form Service Dropdown
The current dropdown options are:
- Brand Film
- Corporate Video & Events
- AI Avatar Campaigns
- Real Estate AI Staging
- Other

**Missing or misrepresented:**
- *AI Staging — Commercial/Corporate* (separate from real estate)
- *Generative AI Video* (a core pillar with no direct form option)
- *Social Media Content* (common entry point for new clients)

Leads selecting "Other" are lower intent. Give them the right bucket upfront.

---

### 2.4 Correct the Duplicate Stat in the Founder Section
The four stats beneath the About section currently read:

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Years Production Experience | 8+ |
| Core Service Pillars | 4 |
| Blue-Chip Clients Served | 8+ |
| Based In | SG |

**Issue:** Two stats both use "8+" — this reads as lazy and wastes a valuable credibility slot.

**Recommended replacement for the duplicate slot:**
- *"Projects Delivered: 60+"* (or actual number)
- *"Turnaround: From 5 Days"*
- *"Industries Served: 5+"*
- *"AI Tools in Stack: 10+"*

---

## Priority 3 — Refinements

### 3.1 Strengthen the Hero Subheadline
The current tagline: *"Where 8+ years of production authority meets cutting-edge AI"* is strong. But the descriptor line beneath — *"AI UGC · Generative Video · AI Staging · Brand Campaigns"* — is functional rather than compelling.

**Suggested refinement:**
> *"We build campaigns that human teams can't match in speed, and AI studios can't match in trust."*

Or keep the service list but add a value layer:
> *"Faster than traditional. More credible than pure AI."*

---

### 3.2 Add Industry Context to the Client Logos
Each logo currently has a category label (Financial Services, Government, FMCG) — this is good. Consider adding one short line beneath the roster:

> *"From regulated financial institutions to government agencies — we understand the compliance expectations and brand standards that come with enterprise work."*

This speaks directly to why the roster matters, not just that it exists.

---

### 3.3 SEO — Add Meta Description and Page Title Optimisation
From the page source, the site title is *"Authoritative Productions — AI Creative Studio"* which is clean. Ensure the following are also in place:

- **Meta description** (~155 chars): something like *"Singapore's AI creative studio combining 8+ years of production experience with generative AI video, AI UGC avatars, and virtual staging services."*
- **Alt text** on all images, particularly the founder photo and logo
- **Structured data / schema markup** for LocalBusiness (Singapore address, contact, service types) — this improves Google Business visibility

---

### 3.4 Add a Footer with Navigation + Contact Details
The current footer contains only *"© 2026 Authoritative Productions · AP — Est. 2025 — Singapore"*.

**Recommended footer additions:**
- Quick nav links (Work, Services, Clients, About, Contact)
- Email address (even a general enquiries address)
- LinkedIn profile link
- Optional: Singapore UEN/business registration number (builds institutional trust with government and corporate buyers)

---

### 3.5 Mobile Responsiveness Check
Given the ticker animation, video embeds, and multi-column stat grid — verify the following render correctly on mobile:

- Hero video autoplays muted on iOS Safari
- The scrolling ticker doesn't clip or break at 375px width
- The 4-column stats grid collapses to 2x2 or stacked on mobile
- The contact form is fully usable without zooming

---

### 3.6 Add a Clear CTA After the Work Section
After viewing the Selected Work tiles, there is no prompt guiding the user to the next step. Insert a short CTA block:

> **"See something you like?"**
> Let's talk about what we can build for your brand.
> [Start a Project →]

This bridges the proof section to the contact form and captures intent at peak interest.
